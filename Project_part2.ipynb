        "In a data science project, your primary objective is to uncover meaningful insights from the data, guided by a central research question or theme (for example: *How does medical insurance influence people’s perception of the healthcare system?* or *How conservative are people in their perception of their role within the family?*). Achieving this objective is an iterative process, consisting of the following steps:\n",
